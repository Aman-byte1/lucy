   - Switched model to `gemini-flash-latest` for quota compatibility.
   - Implemented simple API key authentication and rate limiting.
   - Added usage logging for billing simulation.
   - Created admin dashboard (/admin) and logs endpoint.

2. Frontend Widget:
   - Developed `static/widget.js` and `templates/index.html`.
   - Added multi-turn conversation support using localStorage.
   - Implemented sector-specific context (Banking, Telecom, etc.).
   - Integrated Web Speech API for voice input.
   - Added text-to-speech for responses.

3. Testing:
   - Verified Gemini connectivity with `test_app.py`.
   - Confirmed language support (Amharic test passed).

Next Steps:
- Finalize documentation for deployment.
- Integrate more few-shot examples for Somali.

Recent Updates:
- Upgraded default model to gemini-2.0-flash for better performance and latest features.
- Defaulted language to Amharic/Oromo/Tigrinya in the backend and widget.
- Refined internal system prompt for cultural nuance (Geta/Wey etiquette).
- Simplified Admin Dashboard by moving Knowledge Base and System Prompt "under the code" (hidden from UI but preserved in config).
- Secured API keys in .env and ensured environment compatibility.
